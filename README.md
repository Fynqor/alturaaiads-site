+# Altura AI Ads Landing Page
+
+This repository contains the redesigned Altura AI Ads static site. The latest `index.html` and `404.html` files in this repo reflect the current design.
+
+## Using the files on GitHub
+
+If you want these updates on GitHub:
+
+1. Create (or open) your GitHub repository.
+2. Replace the existing `index.html` and `404.html` in that repo with the versions from this project.
+3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
+
+Once those files are committed, any static hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Amazon S3, etc.) will serve the updated design automatically.
+
+## Local preview
+
+Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file or serve it with a simple HTTP server such as `python -m http.server`) to preview the site before pushing it live.
